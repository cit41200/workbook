# Git and GitHub

**Git** is a powerful version control system that allows you create, store, and work with multiple versions of your source code. Git is open source, free, and available for any operating system.

**GitHub** is one of several services that you can use to store your work and collaborate with others. [GitHub.com](https://github.com) is free and has several services for students.

Each project you create is stored in a **repository**. You create a **local repository** on your computer, and can – when needed – move your work to a **remote repository** on GitHub.

## Using GitHub for Classwork
When putting your working files (classroom project, homework, etc.) into GitHub, it's important to use a **private** repository. This is to prevent academic misconduct and accidentally revealing your work to others.

Even when collaborating with fellow students, you should use a **private** repository and add specific individuals as collaborators to that repository.

```{important}
The university's policies for Academic Misconduct are clear!

**Plagiarism** is the result of using someone else's work (e.g., another student's GitHub repository) and presenting it as your own.

**Facilitation** occurs when you make *your own work* accessible to others.

**BOTH SITUATIONS ARE VIOLATIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT POLICY.** Students who plagiarize *or* facilitate are at risk of failing the course and possible expulsion from their degree program.
