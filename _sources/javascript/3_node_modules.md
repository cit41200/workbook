# Node Modules

Node.js has an `exports` object which allows a developer to create JavaScript objects that can be exposed to be used in other programs. Your JavaScript program can be a combination of internal functions that execute business logic and exported objects that provide a limited interface to your code.

(javascript:modules:intro)=
## Create a Simple JavaScript Module
To demonstrate how the `exports` object works, we will create two new JavaScript files. The first will create a *module* that includes the business logic and a specific object that is exported. The second will implement the module and produce output from it.

In the Cloud Shell terminal, execute the following code:

```
cd ~/41200
mkdir js_modules
cd js_modules
touch Message.js index.js README.md
```

Open the `js_modules` directory in the Cloud Shell editor as you have done previously.

Copy and paste the following code into `Message.js`:

```
exports.SimpleMessage = 'Hello, modules!';
```

Copy and paste the following code into `index.js`:

```
const msg = require('./Message.js');

console.log(msg.SimpleMessage);
```

Execute your code with the following command in the terminal:

```
node index.js
```

You should see the output, `Hello, modules!` in the terminal window. Your `index.js` file imported the code in `Message.js` and was able to access the *exported* object, which was a string stored in the `SimpleMessage` variable.

(javascript:modules:function)=
## Export a Function From a JavaScript Module

A function is an object in JavaScript, so you can export a function from a JavaScript module and then execute that function from another program.

Create a new JavaScript file by entering the following on the command line:

```
touch Math.js
```

Open the `Math.js` file for editing and paste in the following:

```
// Internal helper function (not exported)
const addition = (x,y) => x+y;

// Exported function exposed to other programs
exports.calculate = function (method, x, y) {
    if (method == 'addition') {
        return addition(x,y);
    }
}
```

Then open the `index.js` file. Select the existing code and replace it with the following:

```
const math = require('./Math.js');

console.log(math.calculate('addition', 3, 5));
```

Finally, run your code by entering the following on the command line:

```
node index.js
```
