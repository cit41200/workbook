# Branching in Git
**Branching** is an important concept in Git. Branches allow you to work on different parts of a program, and allows multiple individual to collaborate on a single project simultaneously.

Branching in Git can get confusing quickly, and there are several different branching strategies that teams can implement. We will learn the basics first and then learn a simple branching strategy that allows you to keep track of the updates you make on *your own* projects.

## The Default Branch
When you create a new git repository, the *default branch* is created for you. This branch, now called `main` can be thought of at the trunk of the tree that represents your program.

```{note}
Older versions of Git used `master` as the default branch name. You can set the default to `main` with the following command: `git config --global init.defaultBranch main`
```

## Making Commits
As you progress through your work, you can make commits in whatever branch is currently active. A `commit` is similar to a checkpoint in a game â€“ it preserves the state of your project precisely as it is at the time of the commit. You can always go look at a previous commit, and can even revert all of the changes you've made and start over from any commit in your project.

## Branching Strategy
Working with branches is an advanced technique in Git. While working on a project that will be revised over time, the simplest branching strategy is to use the `main` branch as your "working" branch where all your changes are made. You can create a `commit` at any point in time you think is worth preserving (such as when you have finished a specific task). 

Once you have finished a new "release version" of your project, you can then create a branch specific for that release. This allows you to preserve the state of your project at a specific point in time. It's similar to a `commit`, but the difference is that branches are isolated from one another and can be independently accessed from GitHub and Visual Studio Code.

An illustration of this strategy can be seen in the following image:

In this image, each circle represents a `commit`. The `main` branch has several commits that denote ongoing updates to the program. At specific points in time, the developer decided to create two "release versions" by making two `branches` (labeled "v1" and "v2" in the image). These branches can then be checked out or easily distributed with unique links from the GitHub platform.

## Implementing the Branching Strategy
Assume you have been working on a project on the `main` branch of your repository. You may have made commits along the way to preserve important points of your work. When you are ready to distribute version 1 of your program, you want to make a "release version" as a separate branch. To do so, perform the following steps (which presume you already have local and remote Git repositories established):

1. Create a new commit to finalize your work: `git commit -m "your message"`

2. Create and "check out" a new branch named `v1`: `git checkout -b v1`

```{note}
When checking out a branch, you use the `-b` flag to create a **new** branch. Once your branches have been established you can move between them with the `checkout` command alone.
```

3. Your program's state has been duplicated into the `v1` branch. You can modify your README file or do any last updates you need. Finalize those with another commit: `git commit -m "your message"`

4. **IMPORTANT**: Return to the `main` branch. This is your working branch, so further changes should occur here: `git checkout main`


5. **OPTIONAL**: if you want to move all your work to your remote repository, you can push all your branches at once with the command: `git push origin --all`

Once pushed, you'll notice that your different branches are available from the branch dropdown menu on GitHub:
