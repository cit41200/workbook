# Create a GitHub.com Account

GitHub.com is a platform where you can host and share Git repositories. You may have used GitHub.IU in previous courses, but we will use GitHub.com in this course.

```{important}
If you already have an account on GitHub.com, you can use it. You do **NOT** need a separate account for each course.
